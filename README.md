# Dynamics-of-4-bar-system

This repository contains the MATLAB Code of Inverse dynamics, Forward dynamics and Inverse kinematics of 4-Bar mechanism. This was done as a part of course project for course MCL-738: Multi-Body Dynamics.

**Dynamic_fourBar.mlx** - Inverse dynamics using DeNOC algorithm which involves making use of Newton-Euler equations.  
**FourBar_FK_EL.mlx** - Forward dynamics using Euler-Lagrange equations  
**fourBar_IK.mlx** - Inverse Kinematics of 4-Bar mechanism  

The results of the analysis can be seen in the **4Bar Analysis.pdf** along with analysis done using commercial softwares *ReDySim* and *Adams View* for comparison.
